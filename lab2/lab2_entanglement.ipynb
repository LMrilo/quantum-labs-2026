    "### Exercise 4: The Reality of Measurement (Shot Noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**\n",
    "In classical computing, reading a bit is a deterministic process: if a bit is `1`, it will always be read as `1`. In quantum mechanics, measuring a state in superposition (like the $|+\\rangle$ state created by the Hadamard gate) forces the wavefunction to collapse probabilistically. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Context:**\n",
    "According to the theory you studied, the H gate creates the state:\n",
    "$$|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\rangle$$\n",
    "The probability of measuring `0` or `1` is exactly 50% ($|1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 0.5$). However, this is a *theoretical* probability. In the real world, measuring a quantum state is like flipping a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications & Your Task:**\n",
    "If you flip a fair coin 10 times, you rarely get exactly 5 Heads and 5 Tails. This statistical variance is called **Shot Noise**. To extract reliable information from a quantum computer, we must execute the same circuit many times (called \"shots\").\n",
    "1. Run the cell below with `NUM_SHOTS = 50`. Observe the deviation from the ideal 50/50 split.\n",
    "2. Change `NUM_SHOTS` to `100`, then `1000`, then `10000`. \n",
    "3. **Observe:** See how the histogram gradually converges to the theoretical 50% distribution. This proves why real quantum algorithms require thousands of repeated executions."

    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**\n",
    "Entangling two qubits is just the beginning. To achieve \"Quantum Advantage\" and solve problems impossible for classical supercomputers, modern hardware (like Google Willow or IonQ Tempo) must entangle dozens of qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Context:**\n",
    "We will extend our circuit to 3 qubits to create a **GHZ State** (Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state):\n",

    "This represents a *multipartite* entanglement where all three qubits act as a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications & Your Task:**\n",
    "While generating this state on a simulator is mathematically perfect, doing it on a real quantum chip is incredibly difficult. \n",
    "The more qubits you entangle, the more fragile the system becomes. Interaction with the environment (heat, radiation) causes **Decoherence**—the leakage of quantum information.\n",
    "1. Run the code below.\n",
    "2. **Observe:** On this ideal simulator, you will only see `000` and `111`.\n",
    "3. **Reflect:** If you ran this on real hardware today, you would start seeing \"error\" states like `001` or `010` appearing in the histogram. Fighting this decoherence is the biggest engineering challenge in quantum computing today."
