    "### Exercise 4: The Reality of Measurement (Shot Noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**\n",
    "In classical computing, reading a bit is a deterministic process: if a bit is `1`, it will always be read as `1`. In quantum mechanics, measuring a state in superposition (like the $|+\\rangle$ state created by the Hadamard gate) forces the wavefunction to collapse probabilistically. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Context:**\n",
    "According to the theory you studied, the H gate creates the state:\n",
    "$$|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\rangle$$\n",
    "The probability of measuring `0` or `1` is exactly 50% ($|1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 0.5$). However, this is a *theoretical* probability. In the real world, measuring a quantum state is like flipping a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications & Your Task:**\n",
    "If you flip a fair coin 10 times, you rarely get exactly 5 Heads and 5 Tails. This statistical variance is called **Shot Noise**. To extract reliable information from a quantum computer, we must execute the same circuit many times (called \"shots\").\n",
    "1. Run the cell below with `NUM_SHOTS = 50`. Observe the deviation from the ideal 50/50 split.\n",
    "2. Change `NUM_SHOTS` to `100`, then `1000`, then `10000`. \n",
    "3. **Observe:** See how the histogram gradually converges to the theoretical 50% distribution. This proves why real quantum algorithms require thousands of repeated executions."

    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**\n",
    "In the Composer exercise, you applied a Z gate to a superposition. The visual result was a color change on the Q-Sphere (from Blue to Red, indicating a negative phase), but the probability bar chart did not change at all. It remained 50/50. \n",

    "**Theoretical Context:**\n",
    "Quantum mechanics allows us to use **Interference** to convert \"invisible\" phase differences into \"visible\" probability changes. \n",
    "By applying a second Hadamard gate, we mix the amplitudes again. \n",
    "* If the phase is positive (No Z gate), the amplitudes for $|1\\rangle$ cancel out (**Destructive Interference**), leaving 100% $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "* If the phase is negative (With Z gate), the amplitudes for $|0\\rangle$ cancel out, leaving 100% $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications & Your Task:**\n",
    "This ability to manipulate unseen phases to amplify correct answers and cancel out wrong answers is the core engine of powerful algorithms like Shor's and Grover's.\n",
    "1. Run the cell below *without* the Z gate. Notice the output is deterministically `0`.\n",
    "2. Remove the `#` symbol in front of `qc_int.z(0)` to activate the phase flip.\n",
